<h1> -----==  Self Destruction Unix  ==----- </h1>

Version 0.1

Self Destruction Unix is a Shell Script for Unix Computer Security. It is free and open source. You can develop and rewrite it into another programming languages.
Every Hacker nor Cracker will always hunt for your root password.
This Shell Script will protect your machine for being stolen,hacked thru SSH root Access nor login shell. Stolen root access is very dangerous, the attacker may run a backdoor, virus, trojan, etc in your machine.
The "Self Destruction Unix" is compactible for:
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Minix
- Solaris
- DragonFly BSD
- OpenBSD
- NetBSD

<br><br><br>

<b>How it works:</b>
- Every time you login as a root whether it from SSH Access nor Terminal Console the "Self Destruction Unix" will protect you.
- Every time you login as a root, the "Self Destruction Unix" will be activated.
- If the user is a "stranger/with a stolen root password" who login as a root, the "Self Destruction Unix" will do its job. 
- But if it is you, you need to deactive the "Self Destruction Unix" as soon before the remaining time which set by you.
- The default time between root logged in time and "Self Destruction Unix" deactive time is 20 secs. More less time is more secure, but please set the lowest time accessable by human for your good. And don't forget to backup your machine before install the "Self Destruction Unix".
- Everytime you failed to deactive the "Self Destruction Unix" will be counted. The maximum failed to deactive "Self Destruction Unix" will set by youself. The default value is 1, you can set it to any value equal lower than 10.

<br><br><br>
<b> How to use: </b>
- Run "$git clone https://github.com/andikasagala/Self-Destruction-Unix"
- Run in console "$sh install.sh" for the first time to install the "Self Destruction Unix".
- Set the delay time (default 20 secs), set the failed to deactive time (default 1).
- After finish to install the "Self Destruction Unix", next time, every time you login to root access you need to deactive the "Self Destruction Unix" before the remaining time.
- Run in console "$sh /root/I" to hold/stop/deactive. You can copy the file "/root/I" to any place for your good and then run your own path "$sh /your/path/of/file/and/filename" and don't forget to remove the original file "/root/I".
- Run in console "$sh install.sh" again to Uninstall/Reinstall the "Self Destruction Unix".

<br><br>
<h4> Topology explanation: </h4>
<br>

<b> A). Conditions: </b>
- My Server installed with "Self Destruction Unix"
- Data backups ready between My Server and My Server's Shadow ( cron mode or sync mode )
- Minions ready



<b>B). On alarm activated:</b>


Step 1 
Self Defense
- Restrict all

Step 2
Counter Attack
- Sending virus, trojan, etc to the attacker.
- DDOS the attacker with multiple 100Gbps nor highest speed DDOS attack.

Step 3
Rebuild
- Rebuild and restore My Server thru My Server's Shadow.

Step 4
Security Sweeping




<b> C).Topology Sketch Events: </b>
1. My Server attacked
2. My Server restricted, backups ready at "My Server's Shadow"
3. Sending command to "My Scanners"
4. Deep scan on attacker
5. My scanners send result to "My Server's Shadow"
6. Decide the mode to "My Counter Attack Server"
7. Sending mode to "My Minions"
8. Final

===========================================

<b>Next Features:</b>
- Restric SFTP access.
- iptables setting.
- Compactible for AIX, HP-UX, SCO, and OS X.
- The script will report the attacker who access root password.
- The script will sending virus, trojan, etc to the attacker.
